Please ensure the following before running MISql
Please load a MySQL DB before running MySQL.  You should load a DB with a very large table, the maximum table size should be 70% of the memory available on the GPU.

Starting MISQL
$ ./MISql -h           prints this Help file.
$ ./MISql              starts the application
Server address:        Enter the address of the server (localhost or IP address)
Login id:              Login Id for MySQL
Password:              Enter password
Database:              Enter Database.  To change DB, you should re-run MISql
Table:                 Enter Table.  To change table, you should re-run MISql
Rows of DB to read:    Enter number of rows to read & process.  0 for all records.
         Once data is entered correctly, you will get the prompt:
MI_Data >             You can enter the commands listed below in any sequence
         Commands supported (case-insensitive) are:
HELP              This file
SET ALL           All the configuration parameters are printed
SET GPU ON/OFF    SET GPU ON executes Select command on the GPU.  OFF executes on the CPU.
SET TIME ON/OFF   SET TIME ON will measure the time taken to execute (for both CPU & GPU)
SET CACHE ON/OFF  SET CACHE ON will allow MySQL on the CPU to cache the last SELECT call
SELECT * FROM <table name> WHERE <field Name>="String" - Any field in the table.
EXIT

A suggested sequence of commands would be:
SET ALL                examine the set parameters
SET GPU ON             Send query to GPU.
SELECT *...            Run the select statement on the CPU/GPU. Any valid field & string.
EXIT                   Exit from MiSQL

Limitations
* We only support MySQL databases.
* Minimal error handling is done.  Please don't experiment.
* The Maximum table size should be 70-80% of the memory available on the GPU and the CPU - whichever is smaller.  You can truncate the table by setting the Rows of DB to read appropriately.
